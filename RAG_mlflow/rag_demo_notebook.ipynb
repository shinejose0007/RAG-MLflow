    "1. Create embeddings for a small set of documents using `sentence-transformers`.\n",
    "2. Index embeddings with `faiss`.\n",
    "3. Perform a simple retrieval for a user query.\n",
    "4. (Optional) Show how to plug retrieved context into a prompt for an LLM.\n",

    "**How to run:**  \n",
    "- This notebook can be run locally or in Google Colab.  \n",
    "- If running locally, create a virtualenv and install the required packages:\n",
